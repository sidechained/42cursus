## CLEAR RETHINK

 Calling your function get_next_line in a loop will then allow you to read the text available on a file descriptor one line at a time until the EOF.

Read line: correct behavior
NULL: nothing else to read or an error occurred

pull raw_lines from file, until there are no more (NULL)


extract_line_from_raw_line
extract_leftover_line_from_raw_line

read_raw_line:

read the raw_line in chunks (of buffer_size)
do the following until a newline is found in chunk:
	read the next chunk from the file descriptor
	concatenate the new chunk onto the end of raw_line
	count the number of bytes read and:
		if -1: return NULL (error)
		if num_bytes < buffer_size: return NULL (EOF)

copy raw_line into *tmp


//


while()



## NEW NOTES

# get_next_line approach notes

key point: a static variable is necessary to store the extra characters read after a newline

Q: must static variable KEEP be declared and initialised outside read_line function and passed in?
A: 

get_next_line()
{
	loop while line != NULL
	{
		line = read_line
	}
}

read_line()
{
	allocate memory of size BUFFER_SIZE + 1, call this BUF

	loop while num_bytes_read > 0
	{
		read next BUFFER_SIZE chars from file, store in BUF

		if \n found in KEEP:
			extract the part up to and including the \n to return it as LINE
			save the rest of the characters in KEEP
	}

}



when read return 0 it means we are at the end of the file

get_next_line function
- returns contents of the line + \n
- or NULL in case of error/nothing more to read
- usage: successively called until a NULL is returned

Q: what happens when buffer size covers two newlines


text:
"First line (10 chars)
Second Line (11 chars)
Third Line
Forth Line"

buffer_size = 24

on first read:
"First line 
Second Line 
Thi"

we keep the part up to and inc the first newline
"First line\n"

the remainder is kept within our static variable 'keep'
"Second Line 
Thi"

A static variable doesnâ€™t lose its memory that easily. Its data persists until the end of the program, whether or not the function in which it was declared ends.

on second read:

our function should:

read n chars from our file
store them in KEEP
if '\n' found in KEEP:
	stop the loop
	split off everything up to and including /n and call this LINE
keep will just have what remains


get_line



## OLD NOTES
https://www.codequoi.com/en/42-get_next_line-project/

Reading in chunks

chunk		raw_line
"Test"		"Test"
" thi"		"Test thi"
"s\nfi"		"Test this\nfi"
- \n detected, exit returning 1
- print everything before \n
- send everything before n back in
"le"
- no_bytes < 4 detected, return 0 (EOF)

Write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor, without the newline.

Files:
- get_next_line.c
- get_next_line_utils.c
- get_next_line.h

Prototype/Parameters:
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);

Ext funcs:
read, malloc, free

Return value(s)
1 : A line has been read
0 : EOF has been reached
-1 : An error happened

BIG Q:
- will this approach still work when chunk size covers more than one nl?

OTHER NOTES:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable

static variable is a variable whose lifetime is the entire run of the program
static memory happens at compile time, not run time
can be modified
Q: how to know when a var should be static and when not?
Q: what are the static variables in our get_next_line?

// ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
// Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a non-
//        negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read.
//        Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to
//        indicate the error.
