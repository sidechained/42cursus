// compares the first (at most) n bytes of the two strings s1 and s2.
// The comparison is done using unsigned characters.

// strcmp() returns an integer indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:
// • 0, if the s1 and s2 are equal;
// • a negative value if s1 is less than s2;
// • a positive value if s1 is greater than s2.
