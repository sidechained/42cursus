// The strrchr() function shall locate the last occurrence of c
// (converted to a char) in the string pointed to by s.  The
// terminating NUL character is considered to be part of the string.
// Upon successful completion, strrchr() shall return a pointer to
// the byte or a null pointer if c does not occur in the string.
