// If c is an uppercase letter, tolower() returns its lowercase equivalent
// if a lowercase representation exists in the current locale
// otherwise, it returns c.
// If c is neither an unsigned char value nor EOF, the behavior of these functions is undefined.
// The value returned is that of the converted letter, or c if the conversion was not possible.
