// The strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string s.
// Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc(3), and can be freed with free(3).
// On success, the strdup() function returns a pointer to the duplicated string.
// It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available, with errno set to indicate the error.
