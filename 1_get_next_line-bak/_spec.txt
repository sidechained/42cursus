Reading in chunks

chunk		raw_line
"Test"		"Test"
" thi"		"Test thi"
"s\nfi"		"Test this\nfi"
- \n detected, exit returning 1
- print everything before \n
- send everything before n back in
"le"
- no_bytes < 4 detected, return 0 (EOF)

Write a function which returns a line read from a file descriptor, without the newline.

Files:
- get_next_line.c
- get_next_line_utils.c
- get_next_line.h

Prototype/Parameters:
int get_next_line(int fd, char **line);

Ext funcs:
read, malloc, free

Return value(s)
1 : A line has been read
0 : EOF has been reached
-1 : An error happened

BIG Q:
- will this approach still work when chunk size covers more than one nl?

OTHER NOTES:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_variable

static variable is a variable whose lifetime is the entire run of the program
static memory happens at compile time, not run time
can be modified
Q: how to know when a var should be static and when not?
Q: what are the static variables in our get_next_line?

// ssize_t read(int fildes, void *buf, size_t nbyte);
// Upon successful completion, these functions shall return a non-
//        negative integer indicating the number of bytes actually read.
//        Otherwise, the functions shall return -1 and set errno to
//        indicate the error.
