A shift-reduce parser is a type of bottom-up parser used in compiler design to analyze and parse the input source code. It operates by building a parse tree from the input tokens by repeatedly applying two operations: shift and reduce.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how a shift-reduce parser works:

    Input: The parser takes a sequence of tokens (lexical units) as input, typically generated by a lexical analyzer (lexer).

    Stack: The parser maintains a stack to keep track of the current state and symbols encountered during parsing. Initially, the stack contains only the start symbol.

    Action: The parser performs two main actions: shift and reduce.

        Shift: If the current input symbol (token) matches the expected symbol based on the current state, the parser shifts the symbol onto the stack and advances to the next input token.

        Reduce: When a group of symbols on top of the stack matches the right-hand side of a production rule, the parser reduces those symbols to the corresponding non-terminal symbol of the production rule. It replaces the group of symbols with the non-terminal on the stack and moves to the next state based on the non-terminal and the previous state.

    Parsing Table: The parser relies on a parsing table, usually generated by a parser generator tool or constructed manually. The parsing table consists of entries that determine the actions to be taken based on the current state and the next input symbol.

        The parsing table includes information about whether to shift or reduce in a particular state based on the current symbol.

        For shift actions, the table provides the next state to transition to.

        For reduce actions, the table provides the production rule to be applied and the non-terminal symbol to replace the reduced symbols.

    Parsing Process: The parser continues shifting or reducing symbols until it either reaches an accepting state (indicating a successful parse) or encounters an error.

        If the parsing table specifies a shift action, the parser shifts the current symbol onto the stack and moves to the next state.

        If the parsing table specifies a reduce action, the parser pops the appropriate number of symbols from the stack (corresponding to the right-hand side of the production rule) and replaces them with the non-terminal on the stack. Then it transitions to the new state based on the non-terminal and the previous state.

        If the parsing table specifies an error action or there are no more input tokens, the parser either raises an error indicating a syntax mistake or finishes parsing if the input is valid.

    Output: If the input is valid and the parser successfully reaches the accepting state, it constructs a parse tree or an abstract syntax tree (AST) representing the syntactic structure of the input source code.

Shift-reduce parsing is often implemented using a parsing algorithm called LR (1) parsing, where "L" stands for "left-to-right" scanning of the input, and "R" means "rightmost derivation" of the grammar. LR parsing is powerful and efficient, capable of parsing a large class of context-free grammars used in programming languages.
